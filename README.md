# GH DLL Injector GUI - Compiled

The result of building https://github.com/guided-hacking/GH-Injector-GUI

Dear future self, the next time you decide to wipe clean your SSD, I hope you can just download and run this amazing app without going through installing Visual Studio 2019, downloading several GBs worth of Qt 5.12.5, compiling with a legacy version of a random VSIX extension, and making sure to re-save each one of the headers as UTF-8 without BOM in case your WSL2 installation decides to screw up the encoding rendering Windows.h imports useless.

I really hope you can just clone this repo and run it.
